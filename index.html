<h1>This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website.</h1>
<aside>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</aside>
<h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
<strong>7 fucking declarations.</strong>
<p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that 
<a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a>
into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it
<em>still</em>
has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
<li><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
<li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
<li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
<li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
</ul>
<h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
<p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
<h2>Let it breathe</h2>
<p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming 
they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are 
  trash -- pick a minimum 
  <code>line-height: 1.4</code>for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.
