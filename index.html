<h1>This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website.</h1>
<aside>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</aside>
<h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
<strong>7 fucking declarations.</strong>
<p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that 
<a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a>
into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it
<em>still</em>
has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Shit's 
<em>still</em> 
lightweight and loads fast
</li>
<li>
<em>Still</em> 
fits on all your shitty screens
</li>
<li>
<em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
<li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
</ul>
